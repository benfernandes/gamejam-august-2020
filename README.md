## Export

You may need to download a (fairly large) template for exporting as HTML5

* Project -> export -> HTML5 (hopefully the correct settings are pulled from `export_presets.cfg`)
* Export Project -> Save as ./export/index.html
* Zip up contents of ./export
* Upload to itch.io or similar (could also serve up the index.html page along with it's static assets in the ./export folder)
* Ensure itch.io is set at 720px x 480px and donation is $0
